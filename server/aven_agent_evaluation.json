For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount remains the same every month.\n\nIf an account has multiple plans, each plan's minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. Additionally, any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest.\n\nTo get an accurate estimate of your specific minimum payment amount, I recommend using our payment calculator tool at [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator).

      "question": "What makes Aven different from other credit cards?",
      "response": "Aven offers a unique credit card experience compared to traditional credit cards for several reasons:\n\n1. **Variable Rate**: The Aven Card operates on a variable rate, meaning the APR can fluctuate based on specific indices like the Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve. This can result in potential changes in APR multiple times a year.\n\n2. **Cash Outs and Balance Transfers**: Aven cardholders have the ability to transfer cash directly from their Aven account to another bank account through CashOuts. Additionally, they can request balance transfers from high-interest credit cards to their Aven card, subject to any associated one-time fees.\n\n3. **Convenient Payment Options**: Aven provides various payment options for cardholders, such as using the Aven Card app to connect their bank account or utilizing existing online banking platforms to make payments to Aven.\n\n4. **Flexible Account Management**: Cardholders have the flexibility to add or remove bank accounts for auto pay or bill pay directly through the Aven Card app or online portal.\n\nWhile specific details about credit score requirements or rewards programs may not be available, Aven's emphasis on variable rates, cash transfer options, convenient payments, and account management sets it apart from other credit cards.
